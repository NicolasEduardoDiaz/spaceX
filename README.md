# SpaceX Proyect

## Description
An aerospace company receives public tenders in order to carry out research focused on intergalactic tourism for the citizens of planet Earth.

To increase their income, they want to create a general portfolio, which allows them to view all the services provided by the rockets available in this company, from the technical information of the product to the possible missions to be carried out.

That said, the UI/UX design team, like the systems team, designed and provided the different *wireframes* and *endpoints* necessary for the *FullStack* designer to make it a reality in a web application designed in HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

##Requirements

To develop the *FullStack* project, the following points must be taken into account: 

- The web application must be developed with the HTML, CSS and JavaScript tools***, where throughout its development it must consume the API proposed for the project.***
- The web application (BackEnd and FrontEnd) will be developed in groups of two people, which will be uploaded to a private GitHub repository shared with the Trainer (Pedro: pedrogomez.campuslands@gmail.com) with the name “PROYECTO-FILTRO_JS_SURNAME1NAMERE1-SURNAME2NAME2 ”, which will contain a (`README`) that documents the purpose of said system and the guide to its use (Implementation, Navigation and Compatibility). Its development will be at the discretion of the developer.

To develop the FrontEnd project division, the following points must be taken into account: 

- The system must be developed with native HTML, CSS and JS and without external libraries. Still, if you want to have external support from a library you can use [lit.dev](http://lit.dev), which can be found [here](https://lit.dev/).
- The application must manage the entire life cycle of the functional components throughout the project in general (Web Components and their derivatives).
- It must be ***responsive*** and manage UI/UX throughout the entire project based on the wireframe proposed by the design team.
